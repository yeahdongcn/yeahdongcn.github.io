## Requirements

Nautilus Desktop requires macOS 10.15 to run.

## Installation

## Tech

Nautilus Desktop uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Sparkle] - Secure and reliable software update framework for Cocoa developers.
* [LetsMove] - A sample project that demonstrates how to move a running Mac OS X application to the Applications folder.
* [LoginItemKit] - A simple Swift package to add non-sandboxed macOS applications to user login items.
* [Yams] - A sweet and swifty [YAML](http://yaml.org/) parser built on [LibYAML](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml).

## Todos

 - Write MORE Tests
 - Add Night Mode
